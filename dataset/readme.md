20230406 UPDATE
(1) df.zqh
The df.zqh is a pandas DataFrame,
the label 1 means Taonin, Peach Seeds,
und the label 0 means Kyonin, Apricot Seeds.
My pandas version is 1.3.5.
just use JOBLIB to load it as a df.
(2)df.csv
The same with df.zqh but a *.csv
just open it by Excel or txt
(3)Taonin_C2 und Kyonin_C4
means 2nd plate of Taonin and 4th plate of Kyonin,
it is common RGB image and HSI image from AROLOST would be updated after my manuscript finishing.
